# CUDA HackPOC

Quick playground for toying around with CUDA, and hopefully cuDNN at some point.
I'm also old and plasma effects are cool.

## Building

Targeting Windows for now.
Requires CUDA, Glew and SDL to be available on the system (and `INCLUDE`/`LIB`/`PATH` environment variables set up so CMake can find things).
